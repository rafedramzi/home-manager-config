Do hard things!
Always measure what you do!
Speak louder and clearer, with confidence!
~ The Grind Continues ~
Learn In Public!
Embrace The Suck.
Pick Stuff That Matter.
“All of men's miseries derive from not being able to sit in a quiet room alone.” - Blaise Pascal
Don’t squander your ignorance
If you can’t tolerate critics, don’t do anything new or interesting.
If an idea is obviously bad find a cheap way to try it because if it turns out it's not bad then it's really interesting
if you have a good idea that's obviously good somebody else has probably tried it before
Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, and weak men create hard times
Luck Is What Happens When Preparation Meets Opportunity - Seneca
