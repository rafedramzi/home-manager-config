      KubeFire is to create and manage Kubernetes clusters running on FireCracker microVMs via weaveworks/ignite.

      - Uses independent rootfs and kernel from OCI images instead of traditional VM images like qcow2, vhd, etc
      - Uses containerd to manage Firecracker processes
      - Have different cluster bootstappers to provision Kubernetes clusters like Kubeadm, K3s, Rancher RKE, RKE2, RancherD, and K0s
      - Supports deploying clusters on different architectures like x86_64/AMD64 and ARM64/AARCH64 (ex: K3s, RKE2, K0s)
